mangaupdates-releases-filter
===================

This script is a fixed/updated version of the [mangaupdates-series-releases-filter](https://userscripts-mirror.org/scripts/show/66979) by chulian

It allows you to filter the [mangaupdates.com](https://www.mangaupdates.com) [release page lists](https://www.mangaupdates.com/releases.html) by whether the series is on your Reading List, Wish List, Complete List, Unfinished List, or On Hold List.  You also have the option to display series from the selected list(s) at the top of the page.

### Installation

You'll need to insall a userscript add-on, such as Violentmonkey or Tampermonkey (linked below).  The script has been tested with Violentmonkey and Tampermonkey on firefox, and with Tampermonkey on Chrome, but does not work with Greasemonkey.

- Firefox -> [Violent monkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/violentmonkey/) or [Tampermonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tampermonkey/)
- Chrome/Chromium -> [Violent monkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/violentmonkey/jinjaccalgkegednnccohejagnlnfdag) or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)
- Opera -> [Violent monkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/)

### Future improvements
Fixing the alternating backgrounds colours in the tables would help with readability.  Something to keep in mind, however, is that user defnined colours for specific genres also need to be respected.
